After countless shelter visits and close calls with various puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of finding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally draining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get attached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my parents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and instantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix.

They weren't tarts, they weren't REALLY puff pastry either, and I couldn't figure out what to call them. And then, as I was talking to a friend about it, we got into a conversation about euphemisms, and the ones we both favor. Hot box got thrown around a bit, but then we hit on the perfect name.

The pastry is flaky and crisp at the same time, the apples are tender and perfectly cooked, and the pecans add a hint of interest inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fk0f07cwosnzlj8tc0a9uchxdyegmsxz.jpg\" alt=\"alt\"></p>\n<p>It's a teeny weeny pie to warm the bits of your soul that have been snowed into.

Without chilling items appropriately, the dough becomes too difficult to work with, and it doesn't cook properly in the oven. So. Chill out.

Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the coconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that looks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but should be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a time until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n</p><p> \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in, so that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it out again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat this process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your pastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous and yielded good results. \n</p><p> \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of four hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well if you're trying to make it in advance. \n</p><p> \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a saucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow the apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so that you have mixture without extra moisture.\n</p><p>\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take off the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in fridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so that it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely. \n</p><p>\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or freezer.\n</p><p> \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike. Watch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds. \n</p><p> \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge and cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a ball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches in diameter. \n</p><p>\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the circumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides, so that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the pictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some filling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n</p><p>\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown and crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay. \n</p><p> \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're like me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the fact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with a bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on their own as well.  \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","title":"Vegan Love Triangles","slug":"love_triangles","published_at":"18 January, 2016","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>I made some sweet potato pie today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1me34o8e4hrj5zs0hqullpkoduharuvp.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This was my second time making this dessert, and I made it in a more or less similar way.</p>\n<p>The first time I made it, I bragged to my housemate, and he asked me if my making a sweet potato pie was cultural appropriation, and I had no idea, because I had no idea sweet potato pie was a thing that black people did.

The pie crust recipe is the same dough as that of my  [Love Triangles](http://cookinginpjs.com/love_triangles/) from last week. The first time I did it, I added a little bit too much ice water - perhaps a couple tablespoons too much - and I wound up with a loose dough I didn't want to add more flour to. So that time, I rolled it out hastily, trying not to handle it too much to avoid the coconut oil melting prior to baking. This time I managed to avoid that pitfall, and carefully added only as much water as was necessary, resulting in a soft, elastic, and close-to-perfect dough. I recommend prepping and chilling that before you do anything else.  \n</p><p>\n2.) I went the simple route; I chopped the sweet potato small, into pieces about a half inch wide. After you do that, douse them in spices and throw them in the oven until they are melt-in-your-mouth cooked. Or, you know, about thirty minutes.\n</p><p>\n3.) Mashed them, add maple syrup, the some almond butter, or the liquid from a can of coconut milk for creaminess, and your spices and extracts. You want to make sure it isn't too sweet, tasting every time you add a new ingredient to - ahem - \"assess quality.\" Make sure that the pie isn't so sweet that you can't taste the sweet potato. The goal is to enhance it so it can be the star, not mask it. \n</p><p>\n4.) Preheat the oven to 375 F. Take out your pie dough which has, of course, chilled for at least four hours at this point, and roll it out gently. Set it into a pie pan/tin, and crimp the edges however you're like. Reserve the cut off bits to create a decoration for your pie. Pop the crust in the oven for about fifteen minutes. \n</p><p>\n5.) After the pie crust has baked for about fifteen, take the pie out of the oven and layer in your filling. You want it to be up until the rim of the pie pan - this filling won't expand, so you can fill it right up. Put the pie back in the oven for about twenty minutes. \n</p><p>\n6.) In the meantime, roll out your spare dough and get creative! I went the way of stars and diamonds because those are the cookie cutters I found, but the world is your oyster. When twenty minutes have passed, take your pie out of the oven and carefully place the decorations on top. Put it back in for another 20 minutes. Proceed to turn on the oven light and watch excitedly, as I did (I think I mistook it for a television).\n</p><p>\n7.) After another twenty minutes have passed, increase the oven temperature to 400 F, and place your pies on the top rack - I like my top crust to be a little brown, and this makes that happen!\n</p><p>\n8.) Take your pie out of the oven and serve it up! I loved it with a dollop of coconut whipped cream, but it would likely also taste good with ice cream, or normal whipped cream, or any manner of things. It was also excellent all on its own. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n","title":"Sweet Potato Pie","slug":"sweet-potato-pie","published_at":"25 January, 2016","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1me34o8e4hrj5zs0hqullpkoduharuvp.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c3","slug":"sweetpotato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c4","slug":"piecrust"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c5","slug":"vegetarian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}}
