There are many phases of a best friend reunion, according to this \nbuzzfeed article\n[http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelseydarragh/when-your-bff-comes-to-town#.nsbQEmYJq].\nPretty much every single thing in that article happened, except in our\nfriendship instead of drinking our weight in wine, we cook. And eat.\n\nA LOT OF FOOD\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure Anagha spent 50% of her time at my place and the other 50% at\nher own parents' house. We didn't even do anything most of the time... I would\nbe working and she would be reading at the opposite end of the table. She had\nalso never met the newest addition to my family, Miggy Pramod, who is basically\nthe most adorable dog known to man.\n\nTrue to form, they became best friends immediately.\n\n\n\nSeriously though, who couldn't love a weirdo that sleeps like this regularly?\n\n\n\nJust look at him.\n\n\n\nThis past August, my dad decided that my mom's birthday gift would be to finally\nget a puppy. My entire family, brimming with excitement, spent hours and hours\nlooking on petfinder.com and various shelter sites for the perfect little CALM\naddition to our family. After countless shelter visits and close calls with\nvarious puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of\nfinding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally\ndraining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get\nattached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my\nparents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and\ninstantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix. He\nwas an adorable 18 pound ball of affection who just wanted to play. One week\nlater, he was ready to come home.\n\n\n\nHe was a VERY little 5 month old puppy. Little did we know that the tiny little\nboy that we brought home was a little more German Shepherd than Beagle.\nCurrently, Miggy is a happy 40 pounds and the obsession of my entire family,\nweird sleeping positions, ear licking fetishes and all.\n\nANYWAYS putting the puppy love aside, whenever we weren't spoiling Miggles with\nnever ending attention, we were watching Netflix and eating All The Brunch. If\nit hasn't become obvious from some of our previous posts\n[http://cookinginpjs.com/brunch-conquers-all/], We LOVE  brunch. Best of all, it\nmeans that we can roll out of bed in our pajamas and enjoy some scrumptiousness\nthat we could concoct using eggs and veggies. Yay Pajamas! YAY Brunch!\n\nThen, it's time for a relaxing, vacation time food coma. There's that one\nepisode of friends where Joey and Ross discover that they are each other's best\nnap buddies. Exactly. Who DOESN'T  want a nap buddy and best of all your best\nfriend?! So we spent most of our afternoons watching Netflix and chilling (no\nnot like that you perv!) but literally watching Netflix reruns and napping with\nmy puppy.\n\nBest. Break. Ever.\n\n\n\nWe also love Mexican food. No explanation needed. It's just the best. So\nOBVIOUSLY nothing could be better than combining the two things we are always\ncraving. In came chilaquiles.\n\nI've had varieties of chilaquiles in the past. From the beaches of Cancun to the\nstreets of San Francisco and San Diego. Everywhere, they put their own spin on\nthe classic Mexican dish. Traditionally it's kept very simple with just fried\ntortillas, salsa, egg, and beans (and/or meat). California, on the other hand,\ntends to add avocado to everything so it's very colorful. Our variation probably\nincludes WAY more vegetables than most but I love it and it tasted delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChilaquiles\nIngredients:\n1 bottle Salsa Verde\n[http://www.lavictoria.com/products/salsa/thickn-chunky-salsa-verde-medium/]\n 1 bag tortilla chips\n 1 can black beans\n Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning\n[http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/]\n 1 avocado cubed\n 1 egg per person\n sour cream\n cheese (shredded or Cotija)\n chopping cilantro to garnish\n Pico De Gallo Salsa\n2 roma tomatoes\n 1/2 onion diced\n 1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n lemon juice to taste\n salt to taste\n Corn Salsa\n1 can sweet corn kernels\n 4 sliced jalapeños (more or less based on your spice tolerance)\n lemon juice to taste\n salt to taste\n Directions:\nPut two handfuls of tortilla chips in a pan and cover with the salsa verde. Let\nthe chips soak on low-medium heat while completing the remaining steps. Make\nsure to stir occasionally so all of the chips are covered in salsa\n\nCook the beans with as much of Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning as you\nlike. For each salsa, combine the ingredients in a bowl and keep to the side.\n\nWhen the beans are almost done, make one sunny side up egg for each person. You\nare more than welcome to scramble them if you don't like runny eggs.\n\nSpread the soaked tortilla chips on each plate. Layer the beans, egg, salsas,\navocado, cheese, sour cream and cilantro on top of the chips. Grab your fork and\nknife and let the egg yolk flow. ;)","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fco4k8iom9446zmbd42f9dby9n7o3cmn.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29c","name":"friends","slug":"friends"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b8","name":"puppy","slug":"puppy"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b9","name":"chilaquiles","slug":"chilaquiles"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ba","name":"reunion","slug":"reunion"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bf","name":"naps","slug":"naps"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c382","uuid":"3ef7f523-4fb4-48a5-9fef-b4252d38d598","title":"Vegan Love Triangles","slug":"love_triangles","published_at":"18 January, 2016","plaintext":"When I was making these pastries and trying to find a name for them, I kept\ndrawing a blank. They weren't tarts, they weren't REALLY puff pastry either, and\nI couldn't figure out what to call them. And then, as I was talking to a friend\nabout it, we got into a conversation about euphemisms, and the ones we both\nfavor. Hot box got thrown around a bit, but then we hit on the perfect name.\nVisually accurate (the pastries are triangles) and a little silly.\n\n\n\nLove Triangles.\n\nAnd look, I know it says vegan up there at the top, and I can hear what you're\nthinking: you don't usually like vegan pastry! It's dry, or it's weird, and are\nthere lentils in there because you heard that vegans put lentils in everything!\n\n\n\nBut these pastries don't taste vegan. I think there's this idea that vegan food\nhas to be healthy, and taste healthy, and while I would definitely advocate for\nhealthy food generally, that's not the case here. This recipe is full of lovely\nfats in the form of coconut oil, and yummy yummy carbs. It's delicious. You\nwon't believe it's not butter in there. The pastry is flaky and crisp at the\nsame time, the apples are tender and perfectly cooked, and the pecans add a hint\nof interest inside.\n\n\n\nIt's a teeny weeny pie to warm the bits of your soul that have been snowed into.\nIn the middle of winter, when you come in from the cold, these are the perfect\nbits to warm your hands and your stomach as you cuddle into your couch with a\nwarm cup of tea.\n\nLove Triangles\nThese take a bit of time, but the end result is well worth it. Just note that\nthe chilling instructions aren't really optional; the whole point is to keep the\ncoconut oil intact throughout the preparation, so that when it gets into the\noven, it melts into the pastry creating flakiness and richness. Without chilling\nitems appropriately, the dough becomes too difficult to work with, and it\ndoesn't cook properly in the oven. So. Chill out. Chill your dough, chill your\nbaking trays, chill your filling. Your stomach will thank you later.\n\nYield: 16 mini pastries\n\nTotal Time:  1 hour active, four hours passive\n\nIngredients:\nPastry Dough\n2 C Unbleached All Purpose Flour1 teaspoon salt3/4 C Coconut Oil, cold but\npliableIce Water, 1/4 cup - 1 cup, as needed\n Filling\n4 Medium Apples, preferably a variety, cored and grated\n 1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon1/2 Tsp. All-Spice1/2 Tsp. Nutmeg1/2 Tsp. Cardamom1/2 Tsp.\nBlack Pepper1/2 Tsp. Ginger1/2 Tsp. Orange Extract1 Tsp. Vanilla Extract2 Tsp.\nLime Juice1 C Chopped Pecans\n Directions:\n\n1.) Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the\ncoconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that\nlooks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but\nshould be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a\ntime until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n\n  \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in,\nso that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it\nout again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat\nthis process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your\npastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous\nand yielded good results.\n\n  \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of\nfour hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well\nif you're trying to make it in advance.\n\n  \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a\nsaucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow\nthe apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so\nthat you have mixture without extra moisture.\n\n\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take\noff the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in\nfridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so\nthat it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely.\n\n\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or\nfreezer.\n\n  \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike.\nWatch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds.\n\n  \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge\nand cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a\nball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches\nin diameter.\n\n\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the\ncircumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides,\nso that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the\npictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled\nbaking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some\nfilling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n\n\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown\nand crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay.\n\n  \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're\nlike me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the\nfact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with\na bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on\ntheir own as well.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","name":"warmapplepie","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","name":"allamerican","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","name":"veganpastry","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","name":"puffpastry","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c357","uuid":"37a98e77-e446-4f06-bbf8-6fbc1677f180","title":"The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making FAJITAS!!","slug":"im-making-fajitas","published_at":"14 January, 2016","plaintext":"We all love Ross. Despite his many divorces and nerdy dinosaur quirks, Dr.\nGellar (no not that kind of doctor) was one of my favorite characters on\nFriends. Every time I make fajitas I remember Ross absolutely \"NOT\" being weird\nabout Joey and Rachel starting to go out. One of the most classic Ross moments\non the show.\n\n\n\nI was in India when Netflix released all ten seasons of Friends.\n\nALL. TEN. SEASONS. EASILY. ACCESSIBLE. ON. THE.

In fact, for years I would only eat it if\nit was accompanied by tanks of chutney (why yes, I would like some dosa with\nthat). But then I tried ada (a-day) dosa, and my life changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDosa is a south asian savory crepe - type bread. It's made of rice which is\nsoaked, ground, and allowed to ferment. Ada dosa is the simpler, and to me, much\ntastier cousin - made entirely of rice, lentils, and legumes, it is both\nextraordinarily healthy and delicious.\n\n\n\nThis is the food I beg my mom to make every time I visit home, and is one of the\nfirst things I learned to make when I set out on my quest to learn to cook\nIndian food.\n\nAda Dosa\nThe recipe I'm sharing today is one that I know works, but you can substitute\nall the lentils and legumes with pretty much any other lentil or legume. You\njust have to make sure that you soak the hardier legumes (black eyes peas,\nkidney beans, black beans, etc.) overnight, and the lentils and rice for three\nor four hours. It's also important to have a good rice to lentil ratio. You want\nto make sure that approximately one third of the total quantity is rice, so if\nyou have two cups combined of lentils and legumes, you would want one cup of\nrice in there.\nThese dosas can be eaten with yogurt, any chutney or pickle you like, or, if\nyou're so inclined, plain. They would also be wonderful with sauteed vegetables.\n \n\nYield: Approximately 10 10-inch dosas, 3 - 4 servings\n\nTotal Time:  1 hour active, 12 hours passive\n\nIngredients:\n1/2 cup black beans\n 1/2 cup chana dal\n 1/2 cup toor dal\n 1/2 cup split peas\n 1 cup brown rice\n 1 1/2 tbls fresh ginger\n 1/2 tbls whole black pepper\n 1/2 tbls cumin\n 1/2 cup coconut (dry and fresh both fine)\n 1/2 bunch cilantro\n fresh green chili, to taste\n salt, to taste\n Directions:\n\n1.) Soak the black beans the night before, and start soaking the lentils about\nsix hours before you want to eat them.\n\n\n2.) Combine all ingredients including spices in the food processor with the\nwater you soaked them in, and let it run. The resulting mixture shouldn't be too\nrunny or too thick, and will be a little grainy, but not chunky. While it won't\nbe as smooth as pancake batter, the lentils should be broken down quite well.\n\n\n3.) Once your batter is ready, turn on your stove and let a skillet heat with a\nsmall amount of oil. You want the skillet to be hot and the oil covering the\nsurface - if you put your batter on the skillet too soon it will stick! Put a\nsmall amount of batter in the center of your skillet, and careful spread it out\nwith a spiraling motion until it's the desired size. Pour a small amount of oil\n(1/4 teaspoon) on the surface of the dosa, and then cover the pan.\n\n\n4.) Let it cook for three - four minutes, before removing the cover, and\nflipping the dosa so the other side can cook.\n\n\n5.) Cooking time varies based on the stove and the pan you're using, so give\nyourself a bit of leeway here. If your first dosa falls apart (as mine did)\nscrape it off, rinse your skillet, and start fresh - with a bit of trial and\nerror, these become super easy! Once both sides of your dosa are cooked, it's\nready!

One song. All week. Why you may ask?\nDUH...BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING.\n\n(Now's when you play this song and dance along while finishing to read this\npost.)\n\nMy brother was visiting me for a week and I quickly realized 1) apparently no\none comes to work during the holidays in my office, meaning sub-par lunches and\ndinners all week and 2) I hadn't done groceries in weeks, meaning I didn't have\nanything to feed the kid while he was staying with me. Being the ever so\nresponsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to\ncook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was\nworking from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a\ncollection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While\nbrainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in\nCalifornia, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.\n\nMy next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had\nbought was stir fry vegetables. Voilà! MEXICAN \"STIR FRY\"! Or I guess as normal\npeople call it... TOSTADA BOWLS!\n\n\n\nThere's not really a recipe for this post because honestly I kind of made it up\non the spot. BUT I can give you some bits and pieces of what went in this so you\ncan make your own variation of this dish at home! (I KNOW, how sweet of me.)\n\nThis dish is essentially a layer of cilantro lime rice, refried beans,\nvegetables sautéd fajita style, salmon (totally optional and honestly kinda\nruined the dish for me, my brother's vegetarian one was on point), guacamole,\nsour cream and cotija cheese a.k.a. fancy Mexican cheese. Plus you can throw\nsome chopped green onions on top to make it look all pretty and fancy.\n\n\n\nI've always loved making Mexican food. It's so flavorful and deliciously\nrewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing\nwith unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you\nin on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of\nany Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables,\nit's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how\nauthentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.\n\nSumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning\nFeel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient! Make as much\nor as little seasoning to go in\n\nIngredients:\n2 tsp cumin\n 1 tsp cayenne pepper\n 1 tsp paprika\n 1 tsp salt\n 1 tsp garlic powder\n Directions:\nMix it all together\n\nFor the guacamole, I generally use the recipe graciously provided by Chipotle\n[https://www.chipotle.com/guac-recipe]. Sometimes I add some cumin or replace\nthe jalapeños with cayenne pepper if I'm feeling dangerous. To go off on a\ntangent, couldn't you watch this gif of guacamole being made forever? 1) I feel\nreally bad for/impressed by the person who disrobed all those avocados and 2) I\njust want to dive into that bowl tongue first. (Excuse me while I make myself a\nbowl)\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes later\n\nThat's about it!

I\ncame home craving cookies, which is pretty rare - while I like dessert, I've\nnever especially been a cookie person. In most cases, if there's an option\nbetween a cookie or almost any other dessert, I would choose the other dessert.\n\n\n\nBut that day, I came home wanting a cookie. I wanted something sweet but not too\nsweet, with a bit of a bite at the end. A cookie with a mysterious past, or a\nteasing glint in its eye. Something dark and chocolatey - the type of cookie you\ncan only eat one of.\n\n\n\nI wanted the kind of cookie that overwhelms you and seduces you at the same\ntime. I wanted the Rhett Butler of cookies, and this is what I got.\n\nI'd say it's pretty close.\n\nSpicy Chocolate Cookies\nThese cookies are fool-proof. I thought the batter was too dry, and that I had\ncooked them too long, but neither of these things were true. Also, they're so\ndark, no one will be able to tell if you burn them a little bit. This is not a\ncookie to fear, but one to embrace, with a tall glass of milk (almond or\notherwise) on the side. There are a few different version of this cookie, and as\nfar as I can tell, they are all extremely similar (read: delicious); feel free\nto experiment and see what works for you!\n\nYield: 12 2-inch cookies, 24 1-inch cookies/p>\n \n\nTotal Time:  Approx. 1 hour\n\nIngredients:\n\nCookies\n1 2/3 C Flour\n 1/2 C Unsweetened Cacao Powder1/2 Tsp. Cayenne Powder1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon Powder1\nTsp. Baking Soda1/4 Tsp. Salt1/2 C Canola Oil1/4 C Maple Syrup1/2 C Granulated\nSugar3 Tbsp. Milk\n Topping\n1/4 C Granulated Sugar\n 2 Tsp. Cinnamon\n Directions:\n\nStart by mixing all of your dry ingredients together, until all the spices and\ncacao are fully incorporated.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine your sugar, oil, maple syrup, and\nmilk, and whisk lightly until incorporated. Make a well in the dry spices and\npour the wet ingredients in, mixing until incorporated. The dough should be\ndense and have a texture reminiscent of wet sand.\n\nMix the cinnamon and sugar for the topping. Form the dough into flat disks and\npress the top of each into the sugar before placing on a lightly oiled baking\ntin. Let bake for 30 - 40 minutes. Allow to cool completely prior to eating.\n\n    </p>\n  </div> \n</div>","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/klU5ii_yhduVXILSrGppqt714g1XSRSRnF30MCGT-oGblTAqhcdzVoPoX6tTkW0J0l7Tb_y5YMJApIm2OGEK8tbMU_XNEVhc7cW5QvYnReH_rcid8iKduKSC5LgkS4R2s0Hal9O4Pl2kF-z3eosW5penH176HMm1j0Boxrp1EHMCeaUFAJDm_LSJybLhap6Nx51yfJxi5aG2S319wTEgEg-s_FKg0J0uzkINewzfoQnRlqlq4K3ZkyYRMaBmX7lcccZSvRVzVMavHTMjXWTZL50FBXqpyuarofy5rLxrD4pNvmKBmzox-mmIqTVkcojIwCuX7MlKbvPGQgDFdfcmgbzoi4wnYNc65_qds7HtWtSYihPqH_zOwG95zWEwtY4SMc8cAXIvxuWf5QKqrV-KM9-0CsdkUVwf4Z6fqBVOGG5QxIfHPzCNq_AE9Y4NfBwIJqhii5ECG-LRP0MgcLS5ti4l0GRm4CNTecS8Nlreyw4ARdox2MSKW6GkaZYdQ7OQLJHTglAq2GawyZJ7t3rv5Xz3od5gqmbHLQ0U5sxqwZwzBAK84EHktCG04ZdKPC_a2grk=w362-h643-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2a8","name":"sugar rush","slug":"sugar-rush"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":6,"skip":30,"numPages":10,"currentPage":6}}
