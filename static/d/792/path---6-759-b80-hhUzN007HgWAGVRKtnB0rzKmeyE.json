My entire family, brimming with excitement, spent hours and hours looking on petfinder.com and various shelter sites for the perfect little CALM addition to our family. After countless shelter visits and close calls with various puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of finding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally draining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get attached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my parents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and instantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix. He was an adorable 18 pound ball of affection who just wanted to play. One week later, he was ready to come home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dcypl744jtl2r4ey4gb8xydob6hi09g6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>He was a VERY little 5 month old puppy. Little did we know that the tiny little boy that we brought home was a little more German Shepherd than Beagle. Currently, Miggy is a happy 40 pounds and the obsession of my entire family, weird sleeping positions, ear licking fetishes and all.</p>\n<p>ANYWAYS putting the puppy love aside, whenever we weren't spoiling Miggles with never ending attention, we were watching Netflix and eating All The Brunch. If it hasn't become obvious from some of our <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/brunch-conquers-all/\">previous posts</a>, We <strong>LOVE</strong> brunch. Best of all, it means that we can roll out of bed in our pajamas and enjoy some scrumptiousness that we could concoct using eggs and veggies. Yay Pajamas! YAY Brunch!</p>\n<p>Then, it's time for a relaxing, vacation time food coma. There's that one episode of friends where Joey and Ross discover that they are each other's best nap buddies. Exactly. Who <em>DOESN'T</em> want a nap buddy and best of all your best friend?! So we spent most of our afternoons watching Netflix and chilling (no not like that you perv!) but literally watching Netflix reruns and napping with my puppy.</p>\n<p><strong>Best. Break.

No explanation needed. It's just the best. So OBVIOUSLY nothing could be better than combining the two things we are always craving. In came chilaquiles.</p>\n<p>I've had varieties of chilaquiles in the past. From the beaches of Cancun to the streets of San Francisco and San Diego. Everywhere, they put their own spin on the classic Mexican dish. Traditionally it's kept very simple with just fried tortillas, salsa, egg, and beans (and/or meat). California, on the other hand, tends to add avocado to everything so it's very colorful.

Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the coconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that looks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but should be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a time until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n</p><p> \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in, so that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it out again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat this process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your pastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous and yielded good results. \n</p><p> \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of four hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well if you're trying to make it in advance. \n</p><p> \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a saucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow the apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so that you have mixture without extra moisture.\n</p><p>\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take off the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in fridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so that it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely. \n</p><p>\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or freezer.\n</p><p> \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike. Watch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds. \n</p><p> \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge and cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a ball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches in diameter. \n</p><p>\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the circumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides, so that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the pictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some filling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n</p><p>\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown and crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay. \n</p><p> \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're like me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the fact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with a bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on their own as well.  \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","plaintext":"When I was making these pastries and trying to find a name for them, I kept\ndrawing a blank.

Take your chilled dough out of the fridge\nand cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a\nball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches\nin diameter.\n\n\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the\ncircumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides,\nso that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the\npictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled\nbaking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some\nfilling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n\n\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown\nand crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay.\n\n  \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're\nlike me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the\nfact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with\na bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on\ntheir own as well.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","name":"warmapplepie","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","name":"allamerican","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","name":"veganpastry","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","name":"puffpastry","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c357","uuid":"37a98e77-e446-4f06-bbf8-6fbc1677f180","title":"The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making FAJITAS!!","slug":"im-making-fajitas","published_at":"14 January, 2016","html":"<p>We all love Ross.

Being the ever so responsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to cook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was working from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a collection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While brainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in California, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.</p>\n<p>My next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had bought was stir fry vegetables.

It's so flavorful and deliciously rewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing with unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you in on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of any Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables, it's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how authentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient!

One song. All week. Why you may ask?\nDUH...BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING.\n\n(Now's when you play this song and dance along while finishing to read this\npost.)\n\nMy brother was visiting me for a week and I quickly realized 1) apparently no\none comes to work during the holidays in my office, meaning sub-par lunches and\ndinners all week and 2) I hadn't done groceries in weeks, meaning I didn't have\nanything to feed the kid while he was staying with me. Being the ever so\nresponsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to\ncook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was\nworking from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a\ncollection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While\nbrainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in\nCalifornia, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.\n\nMy next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had\nbought was stir fry vegetables. Voilà! MEXICAN \"STIR FRY\"! Or I guess as normal\npeople call it... TOSTADA BOWLS!\n\n\n\nThere's not really a recipe for this post because honestly I kind of made it up\non the spot. BUT I can give you some bits and pieces of what went in this so you\ncan make your own variation of this dish at home! (I KNOW, how sweet of me.)\n\nThis dish is essentially a layer of cilantro lime rice, refried beans,\nvegetables sautéd fajita style, salmon (totally optional and honestly kinda\nruined the dish for me, my brother's vegetarian one was on point), guacamole,\nsour cream and cotija cheese a.k.a. fancy Mexican cheese. Plus you can throw\nsome chopped green onions on top to make it look all pretty and fancy.\n\n\n\nI've always loved making Mexican food. It's so flavorful and deliciously\nrewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing\nwith unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you\nin on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of\nany Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables,\nit's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how\nauthentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.\n\nSumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning\nFeel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient! Make as much\nor as little seasoning to go in\n\nIngredients:\n2 tsp cumin\n 1 tsp cayenne pepper\n 1 tsp paprika\n 1 tsp salt\n 1 tsp garlic powder\n Directions:\nMix it all together\n\nFor the guacamole, I generally use the recipe graciously provided by Chipotle\n[https://www.chipotle.com/guac-recipe]. Sometimes I add some cumin or replace\nthe jalapeños with cayenne pepper if I'm feeling dangerous. To go off on a\ntangent, couldn't you watch this gif of guacamole being made forever? 1) I feel\nreally bad for/impressed by the person who disrobed all those avocados and 2) I\njust want to dive into that bowl tongue first. (Excuse me while I make myself a\nbowl)\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes later\n\nThat's about it! Just sauté the vegetables of your choosing with some oil and\nfajita seasoning, heat up a can of black beans on the stove with fajita\nseasoning, whip up a bowl of guac, season some rice, and pile it all into a bowl\nfor maximum enjoyment.\n\nYUM\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO!
